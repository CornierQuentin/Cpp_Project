# Purpose of this repository

This repository contains all of my updated programs coded in C++.
Each one will be explained in this README, and each code will be clearly commented in order to be understandable.

# Hello World !

In the folder "hello_world", there is the first code everyone should start with, the hello world ! First code I created in order to learn the process to compile a Cpp code.

In order to run it, you need to download the files and run in the folder the following commands:
'''
$ make
$ ./hello_world
'''

# Prime decomposition

In the folder "facteurPremier", which means prime factor, there is a code that return the prime decomposition of of a number. It could be very useful in many arithmetic problems and could be use for cryptography. I mostly use it for project Euler problems.

In order to run it, you need to download the files and run in the folder the following commands:
'''
$ make
$ ./facteurPremier the_number_you_want_to_decomp
'''

# Sudoku maker

In the folder "sudokuMaker", you will discover a code that solve a given sudoku or make a new one. This code will help me to create an MacOS sudoku app by doing the major logic parts.
